# MikroTik-Iran-IP-List
The MikroTik-Iran-IP-List repository is designed to streamline the management of Iranian IP addresses within MikroTik RouterOS environments. It provides:

An Up-to-Date IP List: A text file containing Iranian IP ranges in CIDR notation, sourced from a reliable provider.
An Automated Import Script: A MikroTik-compatible script to efficiently load the IP list into an address list on the router.
Comprehensive Documentation: A README file with detailed instructions and practical examples of how to use the IP list in firewall rules.
This repository is particularly useful for network administrators who need to:

Mark Packets: Identify traffic to or from Iranian IPs for Quality of Service (QoS) adjustments or monitoring purposes.
Route Traffic: Direct Iranian IP traffic through specific gateways or interfaces.
Filter Traffic: Implement security policies or compliance requirements based on Iranian IP addresses.
